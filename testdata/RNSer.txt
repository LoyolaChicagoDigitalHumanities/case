.p234 THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE.
   AFTERCOURSES BOOK SIXTH.
Shortly relates the gradual righting of affairs after the foregoing catastrophe,
 and
how there resulted another general gathering at Blooms-End; with which, and
a few other particulars, the story closes.
CHAPTER I.
   THE INEVITABLE MOVEMENT ONWARD.
   THE history of the deaths of Eustacia and Wildeve was told through
out Egdon, and far beyond, for many weeks and months. All the
known incidents of their love were enlarged, distorted, touched up,
and modified, till the original reality bore but a slight resemblance
to the counterfeit presentation by surrounding tongues. Whether
Wildeve would have had sufficient ballast of character to return to
Thomasin when once in Budmouth with Eustacia may be doubted;
but when it was discovered that he had at least intended to retum
the next day, no allowance was made, and the fact was dismissed
as not worthy of reiteration. Yet, upon the whole, neither the
man nor the woman lost dignity by sudden death. Misfortune
had struck them gracefully, cutting off their young histories with
a catastrophic dash, instead of, as with many, attenuating each
life to an uninteresting meagreness, through long years of wrinkles,
neglect, and decay.
   On those most nearly concerned the effect was somewhat
different. Strangers who had heard of many such cases, now
merely heard of one more; but immediately where a blow falls no
previous imaginings amount to appreciable preparation for it.
The very suddenness of her bereavement dulled, to some extent,
Thomasin's feelings; yet, irrationally enough, a consciousness
that the husband she had lost ought to have been a better man
did not lessen her mourning at all. On the contrary, this fact
seemed at first to set off the dead husband in his young wife's eyes,
and to be the necessary cloud to the rainbow.
   But the horrors of the unknown had passed. Vague mis-
givings about her future as a deserted wife were at an end. The
worst had once been matter of trembling conjecture; it was now
matter of reason only, a limited badness. Her chief interest, the
little Eustacia, still remained. There was humility in her grief,
no defiance in her attitude; and when this is the case, a shaken
spirit is apt to be stilled.
   Could Thomasin's mournfulness now and Eustacia's serenity
during life have been reduced to common measure, they would
have touched the same mark nearly. But Thomasin's former
.p235
brightness made shadow of that which in a sombre atmosphere was
light itself.
   The spring came and calmed her; the summer came and
soothed her; the autumn arrived, and she began to be comforted,
for her little girl was strong and happy, growing in size and
knowledge every day. Outward events flattered Thomasin not a
little. Wildeve had died intestate, and she and the child were
his only relatives. When administration had been granted, all
the debts paid, and the residue of her husband's uncle's property
had come into her hands, it was found that the sum waiting to be
invested for her own and the child's benefit was little less than
nine thousand pounds.
   Where should she live? The obvious place was Blooms-End.
The old rooms, it is true, were not much higher than the between-
decks of a frigate, necessitating a sinking in the floor under the
new clock-case she brought from the inn, and the removal of the
handsome brass knobs on its head, before there was height for it to
stand in; but, such as the rooms were, there were plenty of them,
and the place was endeared to her by every early recollection.
Clym very gladly admitted her as a tenant, confining his own
existence to two rooms at the top of the back staircase; where he
lived on quietly, shut off from Thomasin and the two servants she
had thought fit to indulge in now that she was a mistress
of money, going his own ways, and thinking his own thoughts.
   His sorrows had made some change in his outward appearance;
and yet the alteration was chiefly within. It might have been
said that he had a wrinkled mind. He had no enemies, and he
could get nobody to reproach him, which was why he so bitterly
reproached himself.
   He did sometimes think he had been ill-used by fortune so far
as to say that to be born is a palpable dilemma, and that instead
of men aiming to advance with glory, they should calculate
how to retreat without shame. But that he and his had been
sarcastically and pitilessly handled in having such irons thrust
into their souls he did not maintain long. It is usually so,
except with the sternest of men. The placable human race, in
its generous endeavour to construct an hypothesis that shall
not degrade a first cause, has always hesitated to conceive a
dominant power of lower moral quality than its own; and, even
while it sits down and weeps by the waters of Babylon, invents
excuses for the oppression which prompts its tears.
   Thus, though words of solace were vainly uttered in his
presence, he found relief in a direction of his own choosing when
left to himself. For a man of his habits, the house and the hundred-
.p236 THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE.
and-twenty pounds a year which he had inherited from his mother
were enough to supply all worldly needs. Resources do not depend
upon gross amounts, but upon the proportion of givings to takings.
   He frequently walked the heath alone, when the past seized
upon him with its shadowy hand, and held him there to listen to its
tale. His imagination would then people the spot with its ancient
inhabitants: forgotten Celtic tribes trod their tracks around him,
and he could almost live among them, look in their faces, and see
them standing beside the barrows which swelled around, untouched
and perfect as at the time of their erection. Those of the dyed
barbarians who had chosen the cultivable tracts were, in com-
parison with those who had left their marks here, as writers on
paper beside writers on parchment. Their records had perished
long ago by the plough, while the works of these remained. Yet
they all had lived and died unconscious of the different fates
awaiting their works. It reminded him that unconjectured factors
operate in the production of immortality.
   Winter again came round, with its winds, frosts, tame robins,
and sparkling starlight. The year previous, Thomasin had hardly
been conscious of the season's advance; this year she laid her
heart open to external influences of every kind. The life of this
sweet cousin, her baby, and her servants, came to Clym's senses
only in the form of sounds through a wood partition as he sat
over books of exceptionally large type; but his ear became at last
so accustomed to these slight noises from the other part of the
house, that he almost could witness the scenes they signified. A
faint beat of half-seconds conjured up Thomasin rocking the cradle;
a wavering hum meant that she was singing the baby to sleep; a
crunching of sand as between millstones raised the picture of
Humphrey's, Fairway's, or Sam's heavy feet crossing the stone floor
of the kitchen; a light step, and a gay tune in a high key, betokened
a visit from Grandfer Cantle; a sudden break-off in the Grandfer's
utterances implied the application to his lips of a mug of small
beer; a bustling and slamming of doors meant starting to go to
market; for Thomasin, in spite of her added scope for gentility,
led a ludicrously narrow life, to the end that she might save
every possible pound for her little daughter.
   One summer day Clym was in the garden, immediately out-
side the parlour window, which was as usual open. He was
looking at the pot-flowers on the sill; they had been revived
and restored by Thomasin to the state in which his mother had
left them. He heard a slight scream from Thomasin, who was
sitting inside the room.
.p237
   'Oh, how you frightened me!' she said to some one who had
entered. 'I thought you were the ghost of yourself.'
   Clym was curious enough to advance a little farther and look
in at the window. To his astonishment, there stood within the
room Diggory Venn, no longer a reddleman, but exhibiting the
strangely altered hues of an ordinary Christian countenance, white
shirt-front, light flowered waistcoat, blue-spotted neckerchief, and
bottle-green coat. Nothing in this appearance was at all singular
but the fact of its great difference from what he had formerly
been. Red, and all approaching red, was carefully excluded from
every article of clothes upon him, for what is there that persons
out of harness dread so much as reminders of the trade which has
enriched them?
   Yeobright went round to the door and entered.
   'I was so alarmed,' said Thomasin, smiling from one to the
other. 'I couldn't believe that he had got white of his own ac-
cord. It seemed supernatural.'
   'I gave up dealing in reddle last Christmas,' said Venn. 'It
was a profitable trade, and I found that by that time I had made
enough to take the large dairy of eighty cows that my father had
in his lifetime. I always thought of getting to that place again
if I changed at all; and now I am there.'
   'How did you manage to become white, Diggory?' Thomasin
asked.
   'I turned so by degrees, ma'am.'
   'You look much better than ever you did before.'
   Venn appeared confused; and Thomasin, seeing how inadvert-
ently she had spoken to a man who might possibly have tender
feelings for her still, blushed a little. Clym saw nothing of this,
and added good-humouredly:
   'What shall we have to frighten Thomasin's baby with, now
you have become a human being again?'
   'Sit down, Diggory,' said Thomasin, ' and stay to tea.'
   Venn moved as if he would retire to the kitchen, when Thoma-
sin said with pleasant pertness, as she went on with some sewing:
'Of course you must sit down here. And where does your large
eighty-cow dairy lie, Mr. Venn?'
   'About two miles to the right of Alderworth, where the meads
begin. I have thought that if Mr. Yeobright would like to pay
me a visit sometimes he shouldn't stay away for want of asking.
I'll not bide to tea this afternoon, thankye, for I've got something
on hand that must be settled. 'Tis Maypole-day to-morrow, and
the Shadwater folk have clubbed with a few of your neighbours
here to have one just outside your palings in the heath, as it is a
.p238 THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE.
nice green place.' Venn waved his elbow towards the patch in front
of the house. 'I have been talking to Fairway about it,' he con-
tinued, 'and I said to him that before we put up the pole it would
be as well to ask Mrs. Wildeve.'
   'I can say nothing against it,' she answered. 'Our property
does not reach an inch farther than the white palings.'
   'But you might not like to see a lot of folk going crazy round
a stick, under your very nose.'
   'I shall have no objection at all.'
   Venn soon after went away, and in the evening Yeobright
strolled as far as Fairway's cottage. It was a lovely May sunset,
and the birch-trees which grew on this margin of the vast Egdon
wilderness had put on their new leaves, delicate as butterflies'
wings, and diaphanous as amber. Beside Fairway's dwelling was
an open space recessed from the road, and here were now collected
all the young people from within a radius of a couple of miles.
The pole lay with one end supported on a trestle, and women
were engaged in wreathing it from the top downwards with wild
flowers. The instincts of merry England lingered on here with
exceptional vitality, and the symbolic customs which tradition
has attached to each season of the year were yet a reality on
Egdon. Indeed, the impulses of all such outlandish hamlets are
Pagan still: in these spots homage to nature, self-adoration,
frantic gaieties, fragments of Teutonic rites to divinities whose
names are forgotten, have in some way or other survived mediaeval
doctrine.
   Yeobright did not interrupt the preparations, and went home
again. The next morning, when Thomasin withdrew the curtains
of her bed-room window, there stood the maypole in the middle of
the green, its top cutting into the sky. It had sprung up in the
night, or rather early morning, like Jack's bean-stalk. She
opened the casement to get a better view of the garlands and
posies that adorned it. The sweet perfume of the flowers had
already spread into the surrounding air, which, being free from
every taint, conducted to her lips a full measure of the fragrance
received from the spire of blossom in its midst. At the top of the
pole were crossed hoops decked with small flowers; beneath these
came a milk-white zone of may-bloom; then a zone of blue-bells,
then of cowslips, then of lilacs, then of ragged-robins, daffodils,
and so on, till the lowest stage was reached. Thomasin noticed
all these, and was delighted that the May-revel was to be so
near.
   When afternoon came, people began to gather on the green,
and Yeobright was interested enough to look out upon them from
.p239
the open window of his room. Soon after this Thomasin walked
out from the door immediately below, and turned her eyes up to
her cousin's face. She was dressed more gaily than Yeobright
had ever seen her dress since the time of Wildeve's death eighteen
months before; since the day of her marriage even she had not
exhibited herself to such advantage.
   'How pretty you look to-day, Thomasin!' said Clym. 'Is it
because of the maypole?'
   'Not altogether.' And then she blushed and dropped her eyes,
which he did not specially observe, though her manner seemed
to him to be rather peculiar, considering that she was only ad-
dressing himself. Could it be possible that she had put on her
summer clothes to please him?
   He recalled her conduct towards him throughout the last few
weeks, when they had often been working together in the garden,
just as they had formerly done when they were boy and girl under
his mother's eye. What if her interest in him were not so en-
tirely that of a relative as it had formerly been? To Yeobright
any possibility of this sort was a serious matter; and he almost
felt troubled at thought of it. Every pulse of lover-like feeling
which had not been stilled during Eustacia's lifetime had gone
into the grave with her. His passion for her had occurred too far
on in his manhood to leave fuel enough on hand for another fire
of that sort, as may happen with more boyish loves. Even suppos-
ing him capable of loving again, that love would be a plant of slow
and laboured growth, and in the end only small and sickly, like
an autumn-hatched bird.
   He was so distressed by this new complexity, that when
the enthusiastic brass band arrived and struck up, which it did
about five o'clock, with apparently wind enough among its mem-
bers to blow down his house, he withdrew from his rooms by
the back door, went down the garden, through the gate in the
privet hedge, and away out of sight. He could not bear to
remain in the presence of enjoyment to-day, though he had tried
hard.
   Nothing was seen of him for four hours. When he came back
by the same path it was dusk, and the dews were coating every
green thing. The boisterous music had ceased; but, entering the
premises as he did from behind, he could not see if the May party
had all gone till he had passed through Thomasin's division of
the house to the front door. Thomasin was standing within the
porch alone.
   She looked at him reproachfully. 'You went away just when
it began, Clym,' she said.
.p240 THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE.
   'Yes. I felt I could not join in. You went out with them,
of course?'
   'No, I did not.'
   'You appeared to be dressed on purpose?'
   'Yes, but I could not go out alone; so many people were
there. One is there now.'
   Yeobright strained his eyes across the dark green patch bee
yond the paling, and near the black form of the maypole he dis-
cerned a shadowy figure, sauntering idly up and down. 'Who is
it?' he said.
   'Mr. Venn,' said Thomasin.
   'You might have asked him to come in, I think, Tamsie. He
has been very kind to you first and last.'
   'I will now,' she said; and acting on the impulse, she went
through the wicket to where Venn stood under the maypole.
   'It is Mr. Venn, I think?' she inquired.
   Venn started as if he had not seen her--artful man that he
was--and said, 'Yes.'
   'Will you come in?'
   'I am afraid that I--'
   'I have seen you dancing this evening, and you had the very
best of the girls for your partners. Is it that you won't come in
because you wish to stand here, and think over the past hours of
enjoyment?'
   'Well, that's partly it,' said Mr. Venn with ostentatious sen-
timent. 'But the main reason why I am biding here like this is
that I want to wait till the moon rises.'
   'To see how pretty the maypole looks in the moonlight?'
   'No. To look for a glove that was dropped by one of the
maidens.'
   Thomasin was speechless with surprise. That a man who had
to walk some four or five miles to his home should wait here for
such a reason pointed to only one conclusion: the man must be
amazingly interested in that glove's owner.
   'Were you dancing with her, Diggory?' she asked in a voice
which revealed that he had made himself considerably more in-
teresting to her by this disclosure.
   'No,' he sighed.
   'And you will not come in, then?'
   'Not to-night, thank you, ma'am.'
   'Shall I lend you a lantern to look for the young person's
glove, Mr. Venn?'
   'Oh no, it is not necessary, Mrs. Wildeve, thank you. The
moon will rise in a few minutes.'
.p241
   Thomasin went back to the porch. 'Is he coming in ?' said
Clym, who had been waiting where she had left him.
   'He would rather not to-night,' she said, and then passed by
him into the house, whereupon Clym too retired to his own
rooms.
   When Clym was gone, Thomasin crept upstairs in the dark,
and, just listening by the cot to assure herself that the child was
asleep, she went to the window, gently lifted the corner of the
white curtain, and looked out. Venn was still there. She watched
the growth of the faint radiance appearing in the sky by the
eastern hill, till presently the edge of the moon burst upwards
and flooded the valley with light. Diggory's form was now dis-
tinct on the green; he was moving about in a bowed attitude,
evidently scanning the grass for the precious missing article,
walking in zigzags right and left till he should have passed over
every foot of the ground.
   'How very ridiculous!' Thomasin murmured to herself in a
tone which was intended to be satirical. 'To think that a man
should be so silly as to go mooning about like that for a girl's
glove. A respectable dairy-man, too, and a man of money as he
is now. What a pity!'
   At last Venn appeared to find it; whereupon he stood up and
raised it to his lips. Then placing it in his breast-pocket--the
nearest receptacle to a man's heart permitted by modern raiment--
he ascended the valley in a mathematically direct line towards
his distant home in the meadows.
CHAPTER II.
THOMASIN WALKS IN A GREEN PLACE BY THE ROMAN ROAD.
   CLYM saw little of Thomasin for several days after this; and
when they met she was more silent than usual. At length he
asked her what she was thinking of so intently.
   'I am thoroughly perplexed she said candidly. 'I cannot for
my life think who it is that Diggory Venn is so much in love
with. None of the girls at the maypole were good enough for
him, and yet she must ha' been there.'
   Clym tried to imagine Venn's choice for a moment; but ceasing
to be interested in the question, he went on again with his
gardening.
   No clearing up of the mystery was granted her for some time.
But one afternoon Thomasin was upstairs getting ready for a walk,
when she had occasion to come to the landing and call 'Rachel.'
VOL. XXXVII NO. CXLVI.
.p242 THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE.
Rachel was a girl about thirteen who carried the baby out for
airings; and she came upstairs at the call.
   'Have you seen one of my last new gloves about the house,
Rachel?' inquired Thomasin. 'It is the fellow to this one.'
   Rachel did not reply.
   'Why don't you answer?' said her mistress.
   'I think it is lost, ma'am.'
   'Lost? who lost it? I have never worn them but once.'
   Rachel appeared as one dreadfully troubled, and at last began
to cry. 'Please, ma'am, on the day of the maypole I had none to
wear, and I seed yours on the table, and I thought I would borrow
'em. I did not mean to hurt 'em at all, but one of them got lost.
Somebody gave me some money to buy another pair for you, but
I have not been able to go anywhere to get 'em.'
   'Who's somebody?'
   'Mr. Venn.'
'Did he know it was my glove?'
   'Yes. I told him.'
   Thomasin was so surprised by the explanation that she quite
forgot to lecture the girl, who glided silently away. Thomasin
did not move farther than to turn her eyes upon the grass-plat
where the maypole had stood. She remained thinking, then said
to herself that she would not go out that afternoon, but would
work hard at the baby's uninished lovely plaid frock, cut on the
cross in the newest fashion. How she managed to work hard, and
   yet do no more than she had done at the end of two hours, would
have been a mystery to any one not aware that the recent incident
was of a kind likely to divert her industry from a manual to a
mental channel.
   Next day she went her ways as usual, and continued her cus-
tom of walking in the heath with no other companion than little
Eustacia, now of the age when it is a matter of doubt with
such characters whether they are intended to walk through the
world on their hands or on their feet, and so they get into painful
complications by trying both. It was very pleasant to Thomasin,
when she had carried the child to some lonely place, to give her
a little private practice on the green turf and shepherd's thyme,
which formed a soft mat to fall headlong upon when equilibrium
was lost.
   Once, when engaged in this system of training, and stooping
to remove bits of stick, fern-stalks, and other such fragments from the
child's path, that the journey might not be brought to an un-
timely end by some insuperable barrier a quarter of an inch high,
she was alarmed by discovering that a man on horseback was
.p243
almost close beside her, the soft natural carpet having muffled the
horse's tread. The rider, who was Venn, waved his hat in the air
and bowed gallantly.
   'Diggory, give me my glove,' said Thomasin, whose manner it
was under any circumstances to plunge into the midst of a subject
which engrossed her.
   'Venn immediately dismounted, put his hand into his breast-
pocket, and handed the glove.
   'Thank you. It was very good of you to take care of it.'
   'It was very good of you to let me.'
   'Oh no. I was quite glad to find you had it. Everybody gets
so indifferent, that I was surprised to know you thought of me.'
   'If you had remembered what I was once, you wouldn't have
been surprised.'
   'Ah, no,' she said quickly. 'But men of your character are
mostly so independent.'
   'What is my character?' he asked.
   'I don't exactly know,' said Thomasin simply, 'except it is to
cover up your feelings under a practical manner, and only to show
them when you are alone.'
   'Ah, how do you know that ?' said Venn strategically.
   'Because,' said she--stopping to put the little girl, who had
managed to get herself upside down, right end up again--'be-
cause I do.'
   'You mustn't judge by folks in general,' said Venn. 'Still, I
don't know much what feelings are nowadays. I have got so
mixed up with business of one sort and t'other, that my soft senti-
ments are gone off in vapour like. Yes, I am given up body and
soul to the making of money. Money is all my dream.'
   'O Diggory, how wicked!' said Thomasin reproachfully, and
looking at him in exact balance between taking his words seriously
and judging them said to tease her.
   'Yes. 'tis rather a rum course,' said Venn in the bland tone of
one comfortably resigned to sins he could no longer overcome.
   'You who used to be so nice!'
   'Well, that's an argument I rather like, because what a man
has once been he may be again.' Thomasin blushed. 'Except
that it is rather harder now,' Venn continued.
   'Why?' she asked.
   'Because you be richer than you were at that time.'
   'Oh no----not much. I have made it nearly all over to the
baby, as it was my duty to do, except just enough to live on.'
   'I am?ú rather glad of that,' said Venn softly, and regarding her
from the corner of his eye, 'for it makes it easier for us to be friendly.'
.p244 THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE.
   Thomasin blushed again, and, when a few more words had
been said of a not unpleasing kind, Venn mounted his horse and
rode on.
   This conversation had passed in a hollow of the heath near the
old Roman road; a place much frequented by Thomasin. And it
might have been observed that she did not in future walk that
way less often from having met Venn there now. Whether or not
Venn abstained from riding thither because he had met Thomasin
in the same place might easily have been guessed from her pro-
ceedings about two months later in the same year.
CHAPTER III.
THE SERIOUS DISCOURSE OF CLYM WITH HIS COUSIN.
   THROUGHOUT this period Yeobright had more or less pondered on
his duty to his cousin Thomasin. He could not help feeling that
it would be a pitiful waste of sweet material if the tender-natured
thing should be doomed from this early stage of her life onwards
to dribble away her winsome qualities on lonely gorse and fern.
But he felt this as an economist merely, and not as a lover. His
   passion for Eustacia had been a sort of conserve of his whole life,
and he had nothing more of that supreme quality left to bestow.
So far the obvious thing was not to entertain any idea of marriage
with Thomasin, even to oblige her.
   But this was not all. Years ago there had been in his mother's
mind a great fancy about Thomasin and himself. It had not
   positively amounted to a desire, but it had always been a favourite
dream. That they should be man and wife in good time, if the
happiness of neither were endangered thereby, was the fancy in
question. So that, what course save one was there now left for
any son who reverenced his mother's memory as Yeobright did?
It is an unfortunate fact that any particular whim of parents,
which might have been dispersed by half-an-hour's conversation
during their lives, becomes sublimated by their deaths into a fiat
the most absolute, with such results to conscientious children as
those parents, had they lived, would have been the first to decry.
   Had only Yeobright's own future been involved, he would
have proposed to Thomasin with a ready heart. He had nothing
to lose by carrying out a dead mother's hope. But he dreaded to
contemplate Thomasin wedded to the mere corpse of a lover that he
now felt himself to be. He had but three activities alive in him.
One was his almost daily walk to the little graveyard wherein his
mother lay; another, his just as frequent visits by night to the
.p245
more distant enclosure which numbered Eustacia among its dead;
the third was self-preparation for a vocation which alone seemed
likely to satisfy his cravings--that of an itinerant preacher of the
eleventh commandment. It was diflicult to believe that Thomasin
would be cheered by a husband with such tendencies as these.
   Yet he resolved to ask her, and let her decide for herself. It
was even with a pleasant sense of doing his duty that he went
downstairs to her one evening for this purpose, when the sun was
sending up the valley the same long shadow of the housetop that
he had seen lying there times out of number while his mother
lived.
   Thomasin was not in her room, and he found her in the front
garden. 'I have long been wanting, Thomasin,' he began, 'to say
something about a matter that concerns both our futures.'
   'And you are going to say it now ?' she remarked quickly,
colouring as she met his gaze. 'Do stop a minute, Clym, and let
me speak first, for, oddly enough, I have been wanting to say some-
thing to you.'
   'By all means say on, Tamsie.'
   'I suppose nobody can overhear us?' she went on, casting her
eyes around and lowering her voice. 'Well, first you will promise
me this--that you won't be angry and call me anything harsh if
you disagree with what I propose?'
   Yeobright promised, and she continued: 'What I want is your
advice, for you are my relation--I mean, a sort of guardian to
me--aren't you, Clym?'
   'Well, yes, I suppose I am;--a sort of guardian. In fact, I
am, of course,' he said, altogether perplexed as to her drift.
   'I am thinking of marrying,' she then observed blandly. 'But
I shall not marry unless you assure me that you approve of such a
step. Why don't you speak?'
   'I was taken rather by surprise. But, nevertheless, I am
very glad to hear such news. I shall approve, of course, dear
Tamsie. Who can it be ? I am quite at a loss to guess. No,
I am not--'tis the old doctor!--not that I mean to call him old,
for he is not very old, after all. Ah--I noticed when he attended
you last time!'
   'No, no,' she said hastily. ' 'Tis Mr. Venn.'
   Clym's face suddenly became grave.
   'There, now, you don't like him, and I wish I hadn't mentioned
him,' she exclaimed almost petulantly. 'And I shouldn't have
done it, either, only he keeps on bothering me so till I don't know
what to do!'
   Clym looked out of the window. 'I like Venn well enough,
.p246 THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE.
he answered at last. 'He is a very honest and at the same time
astute man. He is clever too, as is proved by his having got you
to favour him. But really, Thomasin, he is not quite--'
   'Gentleman enough for me. That is just what I feel. I am
sorry now that I asked you, and I won't think any more of him. At
the same time, I must marry him if I marry anybody, that I will
say.'
   'I don't see that,' said Clym, carefully concealing every clue to
his own interrupted intention, which she plainly had not guessed.
'You might marry a professional man, or somebody of that sort,
by going into the town to live, and forming acquaintances there.'
   'I am not fit for town life--so very rural and silly as I always
have been. Do not you yourself notice my countrifed ways?'
   'Well, when I came home from Paris I did, a little; but I
don't now.'
   'That's because you have got countrified too. Oh, I couldn't
live in a street, for the world! Egdon is a ridiculous old place;
but I have got used to it, and I couldn't be happy anywhere else
at all.'
   'Neither could I,' said Clym.
   'Then, how could you say that I should marry some town man?'
I am sure, say what you will, that I must marry Diggory if I marry
at all. He has been kinder to me than anybody else, and has
helped me in many ways that I don't know of.' Thomasin almost
pouted now.
   'Yes, he has,' said Clym in a neutral tone. 'Well, I wish
with all my heart that I could say, marry him. But I cannot for-
get what my mother thought on that matter, and it goes rather
against me not to respect her opinion. There is too much reason
why we should do the little we can to respect it now.'
   'Very well, then,' sighed Thomasin. 'I will say no more.'
   'But you are not bound to obey my wishes. I merely say what
I think.'
   'Oh no--I don't want to be rebellious in that way,' she said
sadly. 'I had no business to think of him----I ought to have thought
of my family. What dreadfully bad impulses there are in me!' Her
lip trembled, and she turned away to hide a tear.
   Clym, though vexed at what seemed her unaccountable taste,
was in a measure relieved to find that at any rate the marriage
question in relation to himself was shelved. Through several
succeeding days he saw her at different times from the window of
his room, moping disconsolately about the garden. He was half
angry with her for choosing Venn; then he was grieved at having
put himself in the way of Venn's happiness, who was, after all, as
.p247
honest and persevering a young fellow as any on Egdon, since he
had turned over a new leaf. In short, Clym did not know what
to do.
   When next they met she said abruptly: 'He is much more
respectable now than he was then!'
   'Who?--oh, yes, Diggory Venn.'
   'Aunt only objected because he was a reddleman.'
   'Well, Thomasin, perhaps I don't know all the particulars of
my mother's wish. So you had better use your own discretion.'
   'You will always feel that I slighted your mother's memory.'
   'No, I will not. I shall think you are convinced that, had she
seen Diggory in his present position, she would have considered
him a fitting husband for you. Now, that's my real feeling.
Don't consult me any more, but do as you like, Thomasin. I shall
be content.'
   It is to be presumed that Thomasin was convinced; for a few days
after this, when Clym strayed into a part of the heath he had not
lately visited, Humphrey, who was at work there, said to him: 'I am
glad to see that Mrs. Wildeve and Venn have made it up again,
seemingly.'
   'Have they?' said Clym abstractedly.
   'Yes; and he do contrive to stumble upon her whenever she
walks out on Hne days with the chiel. But, Mr. Yeobright, I can't
help feeling that your cousin ought to have married you. 'Tis a
pity to make two chimley-corners where there need be only one.
You could get her away from him now, 'tis my belief, if you were
only to set about it.'
   'How can I have the conscience to marry after having driven
two women to their deaths? Don't think such a thing, Humphrey.
After my experience, I should consider it too much of a burlesque
to go to church and take a wife. In the words of Job, "I have
made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon
a maid?" '
   'No, Mr. Clym; don't fancy that about driving two women to
their deaths. You shouldn't say it.'
   'Well, we'll leave that out,' said Yeobright. 'But anyhow the
times have set a mark upon me which wouldn't look well in a love-
making scene. I have two ideas in my head, and no others. I am
going to keep a night-school; and I am going to turn preacher.
What have you got to say to that, Humphrey?'
   'I'll come and hear ye with all my heart.'
   'Thanks. 'Tis all I wish.'
   As Clym descended into the valley, Thomasin came down by
the other path, and met him at the gate. 'What do you think I
.p248
THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE.
have to tell you, Clym?' she said, looking archly over her shoulder
at him.
   'I can guess,' he replied.
   She scrutinised his face. 'Yes, you guess right. It is going
to be, after all. He thinks I may as well make up my mind, and
I have got to think so too. It is to be on the twenty-fifth of next
month, if you don't object.'
   'Do what you think right, dear. I am only too glad that
you see your way clear to happiness again. My sex owes you
every amends for the treatment you received in days gone by.'
CHAPTER IV.
HUMAN CHEERFULNESS AGAIN ASSERTS ITSELF AT BLOOMS-END, AND 
CLYM
FINDS HIS VOCATION
   ANYBODY who had passed through Blooms-End about eleven
o'clock on the morning fixed for the wedding, would have found
that, while Yeobright's house was comparatively quiet, sounds
denoting great activity came from the dwelling of his nearest
neighbour, Timothy Fairway. It was chiefly a noise of feet,
briskly crunching hither and thither over the sanded floor within.
One man only was visible outside, and he seemed to be later at an
appointment than he had intended to be, for he hastened up to
the door, lifted the latch, and walked in without ceremony.
   The scene within was not quite the customary one. Standing
about the room was the little knot of men who formed the chief
part of the Egdon coterie, there being present Fairway himself,
Grandfer Cantle, Humphrey, Christian, and Sam the turf-cutter.
It was a warm day, and the men were as a matter of course in
their shirt-sleeves, except Christian, who had always a nervous
fear of parting with a scrap of his clothing when in anybody's
house but his own. Across the stout oak table in the middle of
the room was thrown a mass of striped linen, which Grandfer
Cantle held down on one side, and Humphrey on the other, while
Fairway rubbed its surface with a yellow lump, his face being
damp and creased with the effort of the labour.
   'Waxing a bed-tick, souls?' said the new-comer.
   'Yes, Sam,' said Grandfer Cantle, as a man too busy to waste
words. 'Shall I stretch this corner a shade tighter, Timothy?'
   Fairway replied, and the waxing went on with unabated
vigour. ''Tis going to be a good bed, by the look o't,' continued
Sam, after an interval of silence. 'Who may it be for?'
   ''Tis a present for the new folks that's going to set up house-
.p249
keeping,' said Christian, who stood helpless and overcome by the
majesty of the proceedings.
   'Ah, to be sure; and a valuable one, 'a b'lieve.'
   'Beds be dear to fokes that don't keep geese, baint they,
Mister Fairway?' said Christian, as to an omniscient being.
   'Yes,' said Fairway, standing up, giving his forehead a thorough
mopping, and handing the bees-wax to Humphrey, who succeeded
at the rubbing forthwith. 'Not that this couple be in want of
one, but 'twas well to show 'em a bit of friendliness at this great
racketing vagary of their lives. I set up both my own daughters
in one when they were married, and there have been feathers
enough for another in the house the last twelve months. Now
then, neighbours, I think we have laid on enough wax. Grandfer
Cantle, you turn the tick the right way outwards, and then l'll
begin to shake in the feathers.'
   When the bed was in proper trim, Fairway and Christian
brought forward vast paper bags, stuffed to the full, but light as
balloons, and began to turn the contents of each into the recep-
tacle just prepared. As bag after bag was emptied, airy tufts of
down and feathers floated about the room in increasing quantity
till, through a mishap of Christian's, who shook the contents of
one bag outside the tick, the atmosphere of the room became
dense with gigantic flakes, which descended upon the workers like
a windless snow-storm.
   'I never see such a clumsy chap as you, Christian,' said Grandfer
Cantle severely. 'You might have been the son of a man that's
never been outside Blooms-End in his life for all the wit you
have. Really, all the soldiering and smartness in the world in the
father seems to count for nothing in forming the nater of the son.
As far as that chiel Christian is concerned, I might as well have
stayed at home and seed nothing like all the rest of ye here.
Though, as far as myself is concerned, a dashing spirit has counted
for sommat, to be sure.'
   'Don't ye let me down so, father; I feel no bigger than a
ninepin after it! I've made but a bruckle hit, I'm afeard.'
   'Come, come! Never pitch yerself in such a low key as that,
Christian; you should try more,' said Fairway.
   'Yes, you should try more,' echoed the Grandfer with insist-
ence, as if he had been the first to make the suggestion. 'In
common conscience, every man ought either to marry or go a
soldier. 'Tis a scandal to the nation to do neither one nor t'other.
I did both, thank God. Neither to raise men nor to lay 'em low
--that shows a poor do-nothing spirit indeed.'
   'I never had the nerve to stand fire,' faltered Christian. 'But
.p250
THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE.
as to marrying, I own I've asked here and there, though 'ithout
much fruit from it. Yes, there's some house or other that might
have had a man for a master--such as he is--that's now ruled by
a woman alone. Still, it might have been awkward if I had found
her out; for, d'ye see, neighbours, there'd have been nobody left
at home to keep down father's spirits to the decent pitch that
becomes a old man.'
   'And you've your work cut out to do that, my son,' said
Grandfer Cantle smartly. 'I wish that the dread of infirmities
was not so strong in me!--I'd start the very iirst thing to-morrow
to see the world over again. But seventy-one, though nothing at
home, is a high figure for a rover. . . . Ay, seventy--one last
Candlemas-day. Gad, I'd sooner have it in guineas than in
years!' And the old man sighed.
   'Don't ye be mournful, Grandfer,' said Fairway. 'Empt some
more feathers into the bed-tick, and keep up yer heart. Though
rather lean in the stalks, you be a green-leaved old man still.
There's time enough left to ye yet to fill whole chronicles.'
   'Begad, I'll go to 'em, Timothy--to the married pair!' said
Grandfer Cantle in an encouraged voice, and starting round
briskly. 'I'll go to 'em to-night, and sing a wedding-song, hey?
'Tis like me to do so, you know; and they'd see it as such. My
"Down in Cupid's Gardens" was well liked in 'four; still, I've
got others as good, and even better. What do ye say to my
She cal'-led to' her love'
From the lat'-tice a-bove',
'O come in' from the fog'-gy fog'-gy dew'.'
'Twould please 'em well at such a time! Really, now I come to
think of it, I haven't turned my tongue in my head to the shape
of a real good song since Old Midsummer night, when we had the
   "Barley Mow" at the "Woman;" and 'tis a pity to neglect your
strong point where there's few that have the compass for such
things!'
   'So 'tis, so 'tis,' said Fairway. 'Now gie the bed a shake
down. We've put in seventy pound of best feathers, and I think
that's as many as the tick will fairly hold. A bit and a drap
wouldn't be amiss now, I reckon. Christian, maul down the
victuals from corner-cupboard if canst reach, man; and I'll draw
a drap o' sommat to wet it with.'
   They sat down to a lunch in the midst of their work, feathers
around, above, and below them; the original owners of which
occasionally looked in at the open door and cackled begrudgingly
at sight of such a quantity of their old clothes.
   'Upon my soul I shall be chokt,' said Fairway when, having
extracted a feather from his mouth, he found several others float-
ing on the mug as it was handed round.
   'I've swallered several; and one had a tolerable quill,' said
Sam placidly from the corner.
   'Hullo--what's that--wheels I hear coming?' Grandfer Cantle
exclaimed, jumping up and hastening to the door. 'Why, 'tis
they back again: I didn't expect 'em yet this half-hour. To be
sure, how quick marrying can be done when you are in the mind
for't!'
   'Oh yes, it can soon be done,' said Fairway, as if something
should be added to make the statement complete.
   He arose and followed the Grandfer, and the rest also went to
the door. In a moment an open fly was driven past, in which sat
   Venn and Mrs. Venn, Yeobright, and a grand relative of Venn's
who had come from Budmouth for the occasion. The fly had
been hired at the nearest town, regardless of distance and cost,
there being nothing on Egdon Heath, in Venn's opinion, dignified
   enough for such an event when such a woman as Thomasin was the
bride; and the church was too remote for a walking bridal-party.
   'As the fly passed, the group which had run out from the home-
stead shouted 'Hurrah!' and waved their hands, feathers and down
floating from their hair, their sleeves, and the folds of their gar-
ments at every motion, and Grandfer Cantle's seals dancing
merrily in the sunlight as he twirled himself about. The driver
of the fly turned a supercilious gaze upon them; he even treated
the wedded pair themselves with something of condescension; for
in what other state than heathen could people rich or poor exist,
who were doomed to abide in such a world's-end as Egdon?
Thomasin showed no such superiority to the group at the door,
fluttering her hand as quickly as a bird's wing towards them, and
   asking Diggory, with tears in her eyes, if they ought not to alight
and speak to these kind neighbours. Venn, however, suggested
that, as they were all coming to the house in the evening, this was
hardly necessary.
   After this excitement the saluting party returned to their
occupation, and the stuffing and sewing was soon afterwards
finished, when Fairway harnessed a horse, wrapped up the cum-
brous present, and drove off with it in the cart to Venn's house at
North Shadwater.
   Yeobright, having filled the office at the wedding-service which
naturally fell to his hands, and afterwards returned to the house
with the husband and wife, was indisposed to take part in the
.p252
THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE.
feasting and dancing which wound up the evening. Thomasin
was disappointed.
   'I wish I could bc there without dashing your spirits,' he said.
'But I might be too. much like the skull at the banquet.'
   'No, no.'
   'Well, dear, apart from that, if you would excuse me, I should
be glad. I know it seems unkind; but, dear Thomasin, I fear I
should not be happy in the company--there, that's the truth of it.
I shall always be coming to see you at your new home, you know,
so that my absence now will not much matter.'
   'Then I give in. Do whatever will be most comfortable to
yourself.'
   Clym retired to his lodging at the house-top much relieved,
and occupied himself during the afternoon in noting down the
heads of a sermon, with which he intended to initiate all that
really seemed practicable of the scheme that had originally
brought him hither, and that he had so long kept in view under
various modifications, through evil and good report. He had
tested and weighed his convictions again and again, and saw no
reason to alter them, though he had considerably lessened his
plan. His eyesight, by long humouring in his native air, had
grown stronger, but not sufficiently strong to warrant his attempt-
ing his extensive educational project. Yet he did not repine:
there was still more than enough of an unambitious sort to tax
all his energies, and occupy all his hours.
   Evening drew on, and sounds of life and movement in the
lower part of the domicile became more pronounced, the gate in
the palings clicking incessantly. The party was to be an early
one, and all the guests were assembled long before it was dark.
Yeobright went down the back staircase and into the heath by
another path than that in front, intending to walk in the open
air till the party was over, when he would return to wish Thomasin
and her husband good-bye as they departed. His steps were
insensibly bent towards Mistover, by the path that he had fol-
lowed on that terrible morning when he learnt the strange news
from Susan's boy.
   He did not turn aside to the cottage, but pushed on to an
eminence, whence he could see over the whole quarter that had
once been Eustacia's home. While he stood observing the dark-
ening scene, somebody came up. Clym, seeing him but dimly,
would have let him pass by silently, had not the pedestrian, who
was Charley, recognised the young man and spoken to him.
   'Charley, I have not seen you for a length of time,' said
Yeobright. 'Do you often walk this way?'
.p253
   'No,' the lad replied. 'I don't often come outside the bank.'
   'You were not at the maypole?'
   'No,' said Charley, in the same listless tone. 'I don't care for
that sort of thing now.'
   'You rather liked Miss Eustacia, didn't you?' Yeobright
gently asked. Eustacia had frequently told him of Charley's ro-
mantic attachment.
   'Yes, very much. Ah, I wish--'
   'Yes?'
   'I wish, Mr. Yeobright, you could give me something to keep
that once belonged to her--if you don't mind.'
   'I shall be very happy to. It will give me very great pleasure,
Charley. Let me think what I have of hers that you would like.
But come with me to the house, and I'll see.'
   'They walked towards Blooms-End together. When they
reached the front it was dark, and the shutters were closed, so that
nothing of the interior could be seen.
   'Come round this way,' said Clym. 'My entrance is at the
back for the present.'
   The two went round and ascended the crooked stair in dark-
ness till Clym's sitting-room on the upper floor was reached, where
he lit a candle, Charley entering gently behind. Yeobright
searched his desk, and, taking out a sheet of tissue-paper, unfolded
from it two or three undulating locks of raven hair, which fell
over the paper like black streams. From these he selected one,
wrapped it up and gave it to the lad, whose eyes had filled with
tears. He kissed the packet, put it in his pocket, and said in a
voice of emotion, 'Oh, Mr. Clym; how good you are to me!'
   'I will go a little way with you,' said Clym. And amid the
noise of merriment from below they descended. Their path to the
front led them close to a little side window, whence the rays of
candles streamed across the shrubs. The window, being screened
from general observation by the bushes, had been left unblinded,
so that a person in this private nook could see all that was going
on within the room which contained the wedding guests, except
in so far as vision was hindered by the green antiquity of the
panes.
   'Charley, what are they doing ?' said Clym. 'My sight is
weaker again to-night, and the glass of this window is not good.'
   Charley wiped his own eyes, which were rather blurred with
moisture, and stepped closer to the casement. 'Mr. Venn is asking
Christian Cantle to sing,' he replied; 'and Christian is moving
about in his chair as if he were much frightened at the question,
and his father has struck up a stave instead of him.'
.p254 THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE.
   'Yes, I can hear the old man's voice,' said Clym. 'So there's
to be no dancing, I suppose. And is Thomasin in the room? I
see something moving in front of the candles that resembles her
shape, I think.'
   'Yes. She do seem happy. She is red in the face and laugh-
ing at something Fairway has said to her. Oh, my!'
   'What noise was that ?' said Clym.
   'Mr. Venn is so tall that he has knocked his head against the
beam in gieing a skip as he passed under. Mrs. Venn hev run up
quite frightened, and now she's put her hand to his head to feel if
there's a lump.' And now they be all laughing again as if nothing
had happened.'
   'Do any of them seem to care about my not being there?'
Clym asked.
   'No--not a bit in the world. Now they are all holding up
their glasses and drinking somebody's health.'
   'I wonder if it is mine?'
   'No, 'tis Mr. and Mrs. Venn's, because he is making a hearty
sort of speech. There--now Mrs. Venn has got up, and is going
away to put on her things, I think.'
   'Well, they haven't concerned themselves about me, and it is
quite right they should not. It is all as it should be, and Tho-
masin at least is happy. We will not stay any longer now, as they
will soon be coming out to go home.'
   He accompanied the lad into the heath on his way home, and re-
turning alone to the house a quarter of an hour later, found Venn
and Thomasin ready to start, all the guests having departed in his
absence. The wedded pair took their seats in the four-wheeled
dog-cart which Venn's head milker and handy man had driven
from Shadwater to fetch them in; little Eustacia and the nurse
were packed securely upon the opened flap behind; and the milker,
on an ancient overstepping pony whose shoes clashed like cymbals
at every tread, rode in the rear, in the manner of a body-servant
of the last century.
   'Now we leave you in absolute possession of your own house
again,' said Thomasin, as she bent down to wish her cousin good-
night. 'It will be rather lonely for you, Clym, after the hubbub
we have been making.'
   'Oh, that's no inconvenience,' said Clym, smiling rather sadly.
And then the party drove off, and vanished in the night shades, and
Yeobright entered the house. The ticking of the clock was the
only sound that greeted him, for not a soul remained; Christian,
who acted as cook, valet, and gardener to Clym, sleeping at
his father's house. Yeobright sat down in one of the vacant
.p255
chairs, and remained in thought a long time. His mother's old
chair was opposite; it had been sat in that evening by those who
had scarcely remembered that it ever was hers. But to Clym she
was almost a presence there, now as always. Whatever she was
in other people's memories, in his she was the sublime saint whose
radiance even his tenderness for Eustaeia could not obscure. But
his heart was heavy; that mother had not crowned him in the day
of his espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart. And
events had borne out the accuracy of her judgment, and proved the
devotedness of her care. He should have heeded her for Eustacia's
sake even more than for his own. 'It was all my fault,' he
whispered. 'O my mother, my mother! would to God that I
could live my life again, and endure for you what you endured
for me!'
   On the Sunday after this wedding an unusual sight was to be
seen on Blackbarrow. From a distance there simply appeared to
be a motionless figure standing on the top of the tumulus,
just as Eustacia had stood on that lonely summit some two years
and a half before. But now it was fine warm weather, with only
a summer breeze blowing, and early afternoon instead of dull
twilight. Those who ascended to the immediate neighbourhood
of the barrow perceived that the erect form in the centre, piercing
the sky, was not really alone. Round him upon the slopes of the
barrow a number of heathmen and women were reclining or sitting
at their ease. They listened to the words of the man in their
midst, who was preaching, while they abstractedly pulled heather,
stripped ferns, or tossed pebbles down the slope. This was the
first of a series of moral lectures or sermons on the mount, which
were to be delivered from the same place every Sunday afternoon
as long as the fine weather lasted.
   The commanding elevation of Blackbarrow had been chosen
for two reasons: first, that it occupied a central position among the
remote cottages around; secondly, that the preacher thereon could
be seen from all adjacent points as soon as he arrived at his post,
the view of him being thus a convenient signal to those stragglers
who wished to draw near. The speaker was bareheaded, and the
breeze at each waft gently lifted and lowered his hair, somewhat
too thin for a man of his years, these still numbering less than
thirty. He wore a shade over his eyes, and his face was
   nsive and worn; but though these bodily features were marked
with decay, there was no defect in the tones of his voice, which
were rich, musical, and stirring. He stated that his discourses to
were to be sometimes secular, and sometimes religious, but
people
.p256 THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE.
never dogmatic; and that his texts would be taken from all kinds
of books. This afternoon the words were as follows:
   '"And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto
her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for
the king's mother; and she sat on his right hand. Then she said,
I desire one small petition of thee; I pray thee say me not nay.
And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother: for I will not
say thee nay."'
   Yeobright had in fact found his vocation in the career of an
itinerant open-air preacher and lecturer on morally unimpeachable
subjects; and from this day he laboured incessantly in that office,
speaking not only in simple language on Blackbarrow and in the
upland hamlets round, but in a more cultivated strain elsewhere--
from the steps and porticoes of town-halls, from market-crosses,
from conduits, on esplanades and on wharves, from the parapets of
bridges, in barns and outhouses, and all other such places in the
neighbouring Wessex towns and villages. He left alone set creeds
and systems of philosophy, finding enough and more than enough
to occupy his tongue in the opinions and actions common to all
good men. Some believed him, and some believed not; some said
that his words were commonplace, others complained of his want
of spiritual doctrine; while others again remarked that it was well
enough for a man to take to preaching who could not see to do
anything else. But everywhere he was kindly received, for the
history of his life had become generally known.
(The End.)
