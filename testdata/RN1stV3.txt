BOOK SIXTH
AFTERCOURSES
CHAPTER I.
THE INEVITABLE MOVEMENT ONWARD.
THE story of the deaths of Eustacia and
Wildeve was told throughout Egdon, and far
beyond, for many weeks and months. All
the known incidents of their love were en-
larged, distorted, touched up, and modified,
till the original reality bore but a slight
resemblance to the counterfeit presentation
by surrounding tongues. Whether Wildeve
would have had sufficient ballast of character
to return to Thomasin when once in Bud-
mouth with Eustacia may be doubted, but
when it was discovered that he had at least
intended to return the next day no allowance
was made, and the fact was dismissed as not
worthy of reiteration. Yet, upon the whole,
neither the man nor the woman lost dignity

by sudden death. Misfortune had struck
them gracefully, cutting off their erratic his-
tories with a catastrophic dash, instead of, as
with many, attenuating each life to an unin-
teresting meagreness, through long years of
wrinkles, neglect, and decay.
   On those most nearly concerned the effect
was somewhat different. Strangers who had
heard of many such cases now merely heard
of one more; but immediately where a blow
falls no previous imaginings amount to ap-
preciable preparation for it. The very sud-
denness of her bereavement dulled, to some
extent, Thomasin's feelings; yet, irrationally
enough, a consciousness that the husband she
had lost ought to have been a better man
did not lessen her mourning at all. On the
contrary, this fact seemed at first to set off
the dead husband in his young wife's eyes,
and to be the necessary cloud to the rainbow.
   But the horrors of the unknown had
passed. Vague misgivings about her future
as a deserted wife were at an end. The worst
.p259
had once been matter of trembling conjec-
ture; it was now matter of reason only, a
limited badness. Her chief interest, the little
Eustacia, still remained. There was humility
in her grief, no defiance in her attitude; and
when this is the case a shaken spirit is apt
to be stilled.
   Could Thomasin's mournfulness now and
Eustacia's serenity during life have been
reduced to common measure, they would
have touched the same mark nearly. But
Thomasin's former brightness made shadow
of that which in a sombre atmosphere was
light itself.
   The spring came and calmed her; the
summer came and soothed her; the autumn
arrived, and she began to be comforted, for
her little girl was strong and happy, grow-
ing in size and knowledge every day. Out-
ward events flattered Thomasin not a little.
Wildeve had died intestate, and she and the
child were his only relatives. When admin-
stration had been granted, all the debts paid,

and the residue of her husband's uncle's pro-
perty had come into her hands, it was found
that the sum waiting to be invested for her
own and the child's benefit was little less
than ten thousand pounds.
   place was Blooms-End. The old rooms, it
is true, were not much higher than the
between-decks of a frigate, necessitating a
sinking in the floor under the new clock-case
she brought from the inn, and the removal of
the handsome brass knobs on its head, before
there was height for it to stand; but, such as
the rooms were, there were plenty of them,
and the place was endeared to her by every
early recollection. Clym very gladly ad-
mitted her as a tenant, confining his own
existence to two

of money, going his own
ways, and thinking his own thoughts.
   His sorrows had made some change in
his outward appearance; and yet the altera-
tion was chiefly within. It might have been
said that he had a wrinkled mind. He had
no enemies, and he could get nobody to
reproach him, which was why he so bitterly
reproached himself.
   He did sometimes think he had been ill-
used by fortune so far as to say that to be
born is a palpable dilemma, and that instead
of men aiming to advance in life with glory
they should calculate how to retreat out of it
without shame. But that he and his had
been sarcastically and pitilessly handled in
having such irons thrust into their souls he
did not maintain long. It is usually so, ex-
cept with the sternest of men. Human beings,
in their generous endeavour to construct a
hypothesis that shall not degrade a First
Cause, have always hesitated to conceive a
dominant power of lower moral quality than
their own; and, even while they sit down
and weep by the waters of Babylon, invent
.p262 THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE.
excuses for the oppression which prompts
their tears.
   Thus, though words of solace were vainly
uttered in his presence, he found relief in a
direction of his own choosing when left to
himself. For a man of his habits the house
and the hundred-and-twenty pounds a year
which he had inherited from his mother were
enough to supply all worldly needs. Re-
sources do not depend upon gross amounts,
but upon the proportion of givings to takings.
   He frequently walked the heath alone,
when the past seized upon him with its
shadowy hand, and held him there to listen
to its tale. His imagination would then
people the spot with its ancient inhabitants:
forgotten Celtic tribes trod their tracks around
him, and he could almost live among them,
look in their faces, and see them standing
beside the barrows which swelled around,
untouched and perfect as at the time of their
erection. Those of the dyed barbarians who
had chosen the cultivable tracts were, in com-
.p263
parison with those who had left their marks
here, as writers on paper beside writers
on parchment. Their records had perished
long ago by the plough, while the works of
these remained. Yet they all had lived and
died unconscious of the different fates await-
ing their works. It reminded him that un-
foreseen factors operate in the production of
immortality.
   Winter again came round, with its winds,
frosts, tame robins, and sparkling starlight.
The year previous, Thomasin had hardly
been conscious of the season's advance; this
year she laid her heart open to external in-
fluences of every kind. The life of this sweet
cousin, her baby, and her servants came to
Clym's senses only in the form of sounds
through a wood partition as he sat over
books of exceptionally large type; but his
ear became at last so accustomed to these
slight noises from the other part of the house
that he almost could witness the scenes they
signified. A faint beat of half-seconds con-

jured up Thomasin rocking the cradle, a
wavering hum meant that she was singing
the baby to sleep, a crunching of sand as
between millstones raised the picture of
Humphrey's, Fairway's, or Sam's heavy feet
crossing the stone floor of the kitchen; a
light step, and a gay tune in a high key,
betokened a visit from Grandfer Cantle;
a sudden break-off in the Grandfer's ut-
terances implied the application to his lips
of a mug of small beer; a bustling and
slamming of doors meant starting to go
to market; for Thomasin, in spite of her
added scope for gentility, led a ludicrously
narrow life, to the end that she might
save every possible pound for her little
daughter.
   One summer day Clym was in the gar-
den, immediately outside the parlour-window,
which was as usual open. He was looking
at the pot-flowers on the sill; they had been
revived and restored by Thomasin to the
state in which his mother had left them. He
.p265
heard a slight scream from Thomasin, who
was sitting inside the room.
   'Oh, how you frightened me!' she said
to some one who had entered. ‘I thought
you were the ghost of yourself.'
   Clym was curious enough to advance a
little further and look in at the window. To
his astonishment there stood within the room
Diggory Venn, no longer a reddleman, but
exhibiting the strangely altered hues of an
ordinary Christian countenance, white shirt-
front, light flowered waistcoat, blue-spotted
neckerchief, and bottle-green coat. Nothing
in this appearance was at all singular but the
fact of its great difference from what he had
formerly been. Red, and all approach to
red, was carefully excluded from every
article of clothes upon him; for what is
there that persons out of harness dread so
much as reminders of the trade which has
enriched them?
   Yeobright went round to the door and
entered.
   'I was so alarmed!' said Thomasin,
smiling from one to the other. ‘I couldn't
believe that he had got white of his own
accord. It seemed supernatural.'
   'I gave up dealing in reddle last Christ-
mas,' said Venn. ‘It was a profitable trade,
and I found that by that time I had made
enough to take the large dairy of eighty
cows that my father had in his lifetime. I
always thought of getting to that place again
if I changed at all; and now I am there.'
   'How did you manage to become white,
Diggory?' Thomasin asked.
   'I turned so by degrees, ma'am.'
   'You look much better than ever you did
before.'
   Venn appeared confused; and Thomasin,
seeing how inadvertently she had spoken to
a man who might possibly have tender feel-
ings for her still, blushed a little. Clym
saw nothing of this, and added, good-
humouredly:
   'What shall we have to frighten Tho-
.p267
masin's baby with, now you have become a
human being again?'
   'Sit down, Diggory,' said Thomasin, ‘and
stay to tea.'
   Venn moved as if he would retire to the
kitchen, when Thomasin said with pleasant
pertness as she went on with some sewing:
   'Of course you must sit down here. And
where does your large eighty-cow dairy lie,
Mr. Venn?'
   'About two miles to the right of Alder-
worth, ma'am, where the meads begin. I
have thought that if Mr. Yeobright would
like to pay me a visit sometimes he shouldn't
stay away for want of asking. I'll not bide
to tea this afternoon, thankye, for I've got
something on hand that must be settled.
'Tis Maypole-day to-morrow, and the Shad-
water folk have clubbed with a few of your
neighbours here to have one just outside
your palings in the heath, as it is a nice
green place.' Venn waved his elbow towards
the patch in front of the house. ‘I have
.p268 THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE.
been talking to Fairway about it,' he con-
tinued, ‘and I said to him that before we put
up the pole it would be as well to ask Mrs.
Wildeve.'
   'I can say nothing against it,' she
answered. ‘Our property does not reach
an inch further than the white palings.'
   'But you might not like to see a lot of
folk going crazy round a stick, under your
very nose?'
   'I shall have no objection at all.'
   Venn soon after went away, and in the
evening Yeobright strolled as far as Fair-
way's cottage. It was a lovely May sunset,
and the birch trees which grew on this
margin of the vast Egdon wilderness had
   put on their new leaves, delicate as butter-
flies' wings and diaphanous as amber. Be-
side Fairway's dwelling was an open space
recessed from the road, and here were now
collected all the young people from within a
radius of a couple of miles. The pole lay
with one end supported on a trestle, and
.p269
women were engaged in wreathing it from
the top downwards with wild flowers. The
instincts of merry England lingered on here
with exceptional vitality, and the symbolic
customs which tradition has attached to
each season of the year were yet a reality
on Egdon. Indeed, the impulses of all such
outlandish hamlets are pagan still: in these
spots homage to nature, self-adoration, frantic
   gaieties, fragments of Teutonic rites to di-
vinities whose names are forgotten, have in
some way or other survived mediaeval doc-
trine.
   Yeobright did not interrupt the prepa-
rations, and went home again. The next
morning, when Thomasin withdrew the cur-
tains of her bedroom window, there stood
the Maypole in the middle of the green, its
top cutting into the sky. It had sprung up in
the night, or rather early morning, like Jack's
bean-stalk. She opened the casement to
   get a better view of the garlands and posies
that adorned it. The sweet perfume of the
.p270 THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE.
flowers had already spread into the surround-
ing air, which, being free from every taint,
conducted to her lips a full measure of the
fragrance received from the spire of blossom
in its midst. At the top of the pole were
crossed hoops decked with small flowers;
beneath these came a milk-white zone of
Maybloom; then a zone of bluebells, then
of cowslips, then of lilacs, then of ragged-
robins, daffodils, and so on, till the lowest
stage was reached. Thomasin noticed all
these, and was delighted that the May-revel
was to be so near.
   gather on the green, and Yeobright was in-
terested enough to look out upon them from
the open window of his room. Soon after
this Thomasin walked out from the door
immediately below and turned her eyes up
to her cousin's face. She was dressed more
   gaily than Yeobright had ever seen her dress
since the time of Wildeve's death, eighteen
months before; since the day of her marriage
.p271
even she had not exhibited herself to such
advantage.
   'How pretty you look to-day, Thomasin,
he said. ‘Is it because of the Maypole?'
   'Not altogether.' And then she blushed
and dropped her eyes, which he did not
specially observe, though her manner seemed
to him to be rather peculiar, considering that
she was only addressing himself. Could it
be possible that she had put on her summer
clothes to please him?
   He recalled her conduct towards him
throughout the last few weeks, when they
had often been working together in the gar-
den, just as they had formerly done when
they were boy and girl under his mother's
eye. What if her interest in him were not
so entirely that of a relative as it had for-
merly been? To Yeobright any possibility of
this sort was a serious matter; and he almost
felt troubled at the thought of it. Every
pulse of loverlike feeling which had not been
stilled during Eustacia's lifetime had gone
.p272 THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE.
into the grave with her. His passion for her
had occurred too far on in his manhood to leave
fuel enough on hand for another fire of that
sort, as may happen with more boyish loves.
Even supposing him capable of loving again,
that love would be a plant of slow and
laboured growth, and in the end only small
and sickly, like an autumn-hatched bird.
   He was so distressed by this new com-
plexity that when the enthusiastic brass band
p
arrived and struck up, which it did about
five o`clock, with apparently wind enough
among its members to blow down his house,
he withdrew from his rooms by the back
door, went down the garden, through the
gate in the privet hedge, and away out of
sight. He could not bear to remain in the
presence of enjoyment to-day, though he had
tried hard.
   Nothing was seen of him for four hours.
When he came back by the same path it was
dusk, and the dews were coating every green
thing. The boisterous music had ceased;
.p273
but, entering the premises as he did from
behind, he could not see if the May party
had all gone till he had passed through
Thomasin's division of the house to the
front door. Thomasin was standing within
the porch alone.
   She looked at him reproachfully. ‘You
went away just when it began, Clym,' she
said.
   'Yes. I felt I could not join in. You
went out with them, of course?'
   'No, I did not.'
   'You appeared to be dressed on pur-
pose.'
   'Yes, but I could not go out alone; so
many people were there. One is there now.'
   Yeobright strained his eyes across the
dark green patch beyond the paling, and near
the black form of the Maypole he discerned a
shadowy figure, sauntering idly up and down.
'Who is it ?' he said.
   'Mr. Venn,' said Thomasin.
   'You might have asked him to come in,
VOL. III.
.p274 THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE.
I think, Tamsie. He has been very kind to
you first and last.'
   'I will now,' she said; and, acting on the
impulse, went through the wicket to where
Venn stood under the Maypole.
   'It is Mr. Venn, I think?' she inquired.
   Venn started as if he had not seen her--
artful man that he was--and said, ‘Yes.'
   'Will you come in?'
   'I am afraid that I--'
   'I have seen you dancing this evening,
and you had the very best of the girls for
your partners. Is it that you won't come in
because you wish to stand here, and think
over the past hours of enjoyment?'
   'Well, that's partly it,' said Mr. Venn,
with ostentatious sentiment. ‘But the main
reason why I am biding here like this is that
I want to wait till the moon rises.'
   'To see how pretty the Maypole looks in
the moonlight?'
   'No. To look for a glove that was
dropped by one of the maidens.'
   Thomasin was speechless with surprise.
That a man who had to walk some four or
five miles to his home should wait here for
such a reason pointed to only one conclusion:
the man must be amazingly interested in that
glove's owner.
   'Were you dancing with her, Diggory?'
she asked in a voice which revealed that he
had made himself considerably more interest-
ing to her by this disclosure.
   'No.' he sighed.
   'And you will not come in, then?'
   'Not to-night, thank you, ma'am.'
   'Shall I lend you a lantern to look for
the young person's glove, Mr. Venn?'
   'Oh, no, it is not necessary, Mrs. Wild-
eve, thank you. The moon will rise in a few
minutes.'
   Thomasin went back to the porch. ‘Is
he coming in?' said Clym, who had been
waiting where she had left him.
   'He would rather not to-night,' she said,
and then passed by him into the house;
T 2
.p276 THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE.
whereupon Clym too retired to his own
rooms.
   When Clym was gone Thomasin crept
upstairs in the dark, and, just listening by
   g y
the cot, to assure herself that the child was
asleep, she went to the window, gently lifted
the corner of the white curtain, and looked
out. Venn was still there. She watched the
growth of the faint radiance appearing in the
sky by the eastern hill, till presently the edge
of the moon burst upwards and flooded the
valley with light. Diggory's form was now
distinct on the green; he was moving about
in a bowed attitude, evidently scanning the
grass for the precious missing article, walking
in zigzags right and left till he should have
passed over every foot of the ground.
   'How very ridiculous!' Thomasin mur-
mured to herself in a tone which was in-
tended to be satirical. ‘To think that a man
should be so silly as to go mooning about
like that for a girl's glove! A respectable
.p277
dairyman, too, and a man of money as he is
now. What a pity!'
   At last Venn appeared to find it; where-
upon he stood up and raised it to his lips.
Then placing it in his breast-pocket--the
nearest receptacle to a man's heart permitted
by modern raiment--he ascended the valley
in a mathematically direct line towards his
distant home in the meadows.
.p278 THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE.
CHAPTER II.
THOMASIN WALKS IN A GREEN PLACE BY THE&nbsp;
ROMAN ROAD.
CLYM saw little of Thomasin for several days
after this; and when they met she was more
silent than usual. At length he asked her
what she was thinking of so intently.
   'I am thoroughly perplexed,' she said
candidly. ‘I cannot for my life think who it
is that Diggory Venn is so much in love
with. None of the girls at the Maypole were
good enough for him, and yet she must have
been there.'
   Clym tried to imagine. Venn's choice for
a moment; but ceasing to be interested in
the question, he went on again with his gar-
dening.
   No clearing up of the mystery was
   granted her for some time. But one after-
noon Thomasin was upstairs getting ready
for a walk, when she had occasion to come
to the landing and call ‘Rachel.' Rachel
was a girl about thirteen who carried the
baby out for airings; and she came upstairs
at the call.
   'Have you seen one of my last new
gloves about the house, Rachel?' inquired
Thomasin. ‘It is the fellow to this one.'
   Rachel did not reply.
   'Why don't you answer?' said her mis-
tress.
   'I think it is lost, ma'am.'
   'Lost? Who lost it? I have never worn
them but once.'
   Rachel appeared as one dreadfully trou-
bled, and at last began to cry. ‘Please, ma'am,
on the day of the Maypole I had none to
wear, and I seed yours on the table, and I
thought I would borrow 'em. I did not mean
to hurt 'em at all, but one of them got lost.
Somebody gave me some money to buy
.p280 THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE.
another pair for you, but I have not been
able to go anywhere to get 'em.'
   'Who's somebody?'
   'Mr. Venn.'
   'Did he know it was my glove?'
   'Yes. I told him.'
   Thomasin was so surprised by the ex-
planation that she quite forgot to lecture the
girl, who glided silently away. Thomasin
did not move further than to turn her eyes
upon the grass-plat where the Maypole had
stood. She remained thinking, then said to
herself that she would not go out that after-
noon, but would work hard at the baby's
unfinished lovely plaid frock, cut on the cross
in the newest fashion. How she managed
to work hard, and yet do no more than she
had done at the end of two hours, would
have been a mystery to anyone not aware
that the recent incident was of a kind likely
to divert her industry from a manual to a
mental channel.
   Next day she went her ways as usual,
.p281
and continued her custom of walking in the
heath with no other companion than little
Eustacia, now of the age when it is a matter
of doubt with such characters whether they
are intended to walk through the world on
their hands or on their feet; and hence they
get into painful complications by trying both.
It was very pleasant to Thomasin, when she
had carried the child to some lonely place, to
give her a little private practice on the green
turf and shepherd's thyme, which formed a
soft mat to fall headlong upon when equili-
brium was lost.
   Once, when engaged in this system of
training, and stooping to remove bits of stick,
fern-stalks, and other such fragments from
the child's path, that the journey might not
be brought to an untimely end by some in-
superable barrier a quarter of an inch high,
she was alarmed by discovering that a man
on horseback was almost close beside her,
the soft natural carpet having muffled the
horse's tread. The rider, who was Venn,
.p282 THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE.
waved his hat in the air and bowed gal-
lantly.
   'Diggory, give me my glove,' said
Thomasin, whose manner it was under any
circumstances to plunge into the midst of a
subject which engrossed her.
   Venn immediately dismounted, put his
hand in his breast-pocket and handed the
glove.
   'Thank you. It was very good of you
to take care of it.'
   'It is very good of you to say so.'
   'Oh, no. I was quite glad to find you
had it. Everybody gets so indifferent that
I was surprised to know you thought of me.'
   'If you had remembered what I was
once you wouldn't have been surprised.'
   'Ah, no,' she said quickly.
   'But men
of your character are mostly so independent.'
   'What is my character?' he asked.
   'I don't exactly know,' said Thomasin
simply, ‘except it is to cover up your feel-
ings under a practical manner, and only to
show them when you are alone.'
.p283
   'Ah, how do you know that?' said Venn
strategically.
   'Because,' said she, stopping to put the
little girl, who had managed to get herself
upside down, right end up again, ‘because
I do.'
   'You mustn't judge by folks in general,'
said Venn. ‘Still I don't know much what
feelings are now-a-days. I have got so
mixed up with business of one sort and
t'other that my soft sentiments are gone off
in vapour like. Yes, I am given up body
and soul to the making of money. Money
is all my dream.'
   'O Diggory, how wicked!' said Thoma-
sin reproachfully, and looking at him in ex-
act balance between taking his words seriously
and judging them as said to tease her.
   'Yes, 'tis rather a rum course,' said Venn
in the bland tone of one comfortably resigned
to sins he could no longer overcome.
   'You, who used to be so nice!'
   'Well, that's an argument I rather like,
.p284 THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE.
because what a man has once been he may
be again.' Thomasin blushed. ‘Except that
it is rather harder now,' Venn continued.
   'Why?' she asked.
   'Because you be richer than you were at
that time.'
   'Oh, no--not much. I have made it
nearly all over to the baby, as it was my
duty to do, except just enough to live on.'
   'I am rather glad of that,' said Venn
softly, and regarding her from the corner of
his eye, ‘for it makes it easier for us to be
friendly.'
   Thomasin blushed again, and, when a
few more words had been said of a not un-
pleasing kind, Venn mounted his horse and
rode on.
   This conversation had passed in a hollow
of the heath near the old Roman road, a
place much frequented by Thomasin. And
it might have been observed that she did
not in future walk that way less often from
having met Venn there now. Whether or
.p285
not Venn abstained from riding thither be-
cause he had met Thomasin in the same
place might easily have been guessed from
her proceedings about two months later in
the same year.

CHAPTER III.
THE SERIOUS DISCOURSE OF CLYM WITH HIS
COUSIN.
THROUGHOUT this period Yeobright had more
or less pondered on his duty to his cousin
Thomasin. He could not help feeling that
it would be a pitiful waste of sweet material
if the tender-natured thing should be doomed
from this early stage of her life onwards to
dribble away her winsome qualities on lonely
   gorse and fern. But he felt this as an
economist merely, and not as a lover. His
passion for Eustacia had been a sort of
conserve of his whole life, and he had
nothing more of that supreme quality left
to bestow. So far the obvious thing was
not to entertain any idea of marriage with
Thomasin, even to oblige her.
   But this was not all. Years ago there
had been in his mother's mind a great fancy
about Thomasin and himself. It had not
positively amounted to a desire, but it had
always been a favourite dream. That they
should be man and wife in good time, if the
happiness of neither were endangered there-
by, was the fancy in question. So that what
course save one was there now left for any
son who reverenced his mother's memory
as Yeobright did? It is an unfortunate fact
that any particular whim of parents, which
might have been dispersed by half an hour's
conversation during their lives, becomes sub-
limated by their deaths into a fiat the most
absolute, with such results to conscientious
children as those parents, had they lived,
would have been the first to decry.
   Had only Yeobright's own future been
involved he would have proposed to Thoma-
sin with a ready heart. He had nothing to
lose by carrying out a dead mother's hope.
But he dreaded to contemplate Thomasin
.p288 THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE.
wedded to the mere corpse of a lover that
he now felt himself to be. He had but three
activities alive in him. One was his almost
daily walk to the little graveyard wherein
his mother lay; another, his just as frequent
visits by night to the more distant enclosure
which numbered Eustacia among its dead;
the third was self-preparation for a vocation
which alone seemed likely to satisfy his
cravings—that of an itinerant preacher of
the eleventh commandment. It was diffi-
cult to believe that Thomasin would be
cheered by a husband with such tendencies
as these.
   Yet he resolved to ask her, and let her
decide for herself It was even with a plea-
sant sense of doing his duty that he went
downstairs to her one evening for this pur-
   pose, when the sun was sending up the valley
the same long shadow of the housetop that
he had seen lying there times out of number
while his mother lived.
Thomasin was not in her room, and he
.p289
found her in the front garden. ‘ I have long
been wanting, Thomasin,' he began, ‘to say
something about a matter that concerns both
our futures.'
   'And you are going to say it now?' she
remarked quickly, colouring as she met his
   gaze. ‘Do stop a minute, Clym, and let me
speak first, for, oddly enough, I have been
wanting to say something to you.'
'By all means say on, Tamsie.'
   'I suppose nobody can overhear us?' she
went on, casting her eyes around and lower-
ing her voice. ‘Well, first you will promise
me this--that you won't be angry and call me
anything harsh if you disagree with what I
propose?'
   Yeobright promised, and she continued:
'What I want is your advice, for you are my
relation--I mean, a sort of guardian to me--
aren't you, Clym?'
   'Well, yes, I suppose I am ;--a sort of
guardian. In fact, I am, of course,' he said,
altogether perplexed as to her drift.
VOL. III.
   'I am thinking of marrying,' she then
observed blandly. ‘But I shall not marry
unless you assure me that you approve of
such a step. Why don't you speak?'
   'I was taken rather by surprise. But,
nevertheless, I am very glad to hear such
news. I shall approve, of course, dear Tam-
sie. Who can it be? I am quite at a loss
to guess. No, I am not--'tis the old Doctor!
   --not that I mean to call him old, for he is
not very old after all. Ah--I noticed when
he attended you last time!'
'No, no,' she said hastily.&nbsp;
Venn.'
''Tis Mr.
Clym's face suddenly became grave.
   'There, now, you don't like him, and I
wish I hadn't mentioned him,' she exclaimed
almost petulantly. ‘And I shouldn't have
done it, either, only he keeps on bothering
me so till I don't know what to do.'
   Clym looked out of window. ‘I like
Venn well enough,' he answered at last.
'He is a verv honest and at the same time
.p291
astute man. He is clever too, as is proved
by his having got you to favour him. But
really, Thomasin, he is not quite----'
--
   'Gentleman enough for me? That is
just what I feel. I am sorry now that I
asked you, and I won't think any more of
him. At the same time I must marry him if
I marry anybody,--that I will say.'
'I don't see that,' said Clym, carefully
concealing every clue to his own interrupted
intention, which she plainly had not guessed.
   'You might marry a professional man, or
somebody of that sort, by going into the town
to live and forming acquaintances there.'
   'I am not fit for town life--so very
rural and silly as I always have been. Do
not you yourself notice my countrified
ways?'
'Well, when I came home from Paris I
did, a little; but I don't now.'
   'That's because you have got countrified
too. Oh, I couldn't live in a street for the
world! Egdon is a ridiculous old place;
U2
.p292 THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE.
but I have got used to it, and I couldn't be
happy anywhere else at all.'
'Neither could I,' said Clym.
'Then how could you say that I should
marry some town man? I am sure, say
what you will, that I must marry Diggory, if
I marry at all. He has been kinder to me
than anybody else, and has helped me in
many ways that I don't know of.' Thomasin
almost pouted now.
   'Yes, he has,' said Clym in a neutral
tone. ‘Well, I wish with all my heart that
I could say, marry him. But I cannot for-
   get what my mother thought on that matter,
and it goes rather against me not to respect
her opinion. There is too much reason why
we should do the little we can to respect it
now.'
'Very well, then,' sighed Thomasin. ‘I
will say no more.'
'But you are not bound to obey my
wishes. I merely say what I think.'
'Oh, no--I don't want to be rebellious in
.p293
that way,' she said sadly. ‘I had no busi-
ness to think of him--I ought to have thought
of my family. What dreadfully bad impulses
there are in me!' Her lip trembled, and she
turned away to hide a tear.
   Clym, though vexed at what seemed her
unaccountable taste, was in a measure re-
lieved to find that at any rate the marriage
question in relation to himself was shelved.
Through several succeeding days he saw her
at different times from the window of his
room moping disconsolately about the gar-
den. He was half angry with her for choos-
ing Venn; then he was grieved at having
put himself in the way of Venn's happiness,
who was, after all, as honest and persevering
a young fellow as any on Egdon, since he
had turned over a new leaf. In short, Clym
did not know what to do.
   When next they met she said abruptly,
'He is much more respectable now than he
was then!'
'Who? Oh, yes, Diggory Venn.'
.p294 THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE.
'Aunt only objected because he was a
reddleman.'
   'Well, Thomasin, perhaps I don't know
all the particulars of my mother's wish. So
you had better use your own discretion.'
'You will always feel that I slighted your
mother's memory.'
   'No, I will not. I shall think you are
convinced that, had she seen Diggory in his
present position, she would have considered
him a fitting husband for you. Now, that's
my real feeling. Don't consult me any more,
but do as you like, Thomasin. I shall be
content.'
   It is to be presumed that Thomasin was
convinced; for a few days after this, when
Clym strayed into a part of the heath that he
had not lately visited, Humphrey, who was
at work there, said to him, ‘I am glad to
see that Mrs. Wildeve and Venn have made
it up again, seemingly.'
'Have they?' said Clym, abstractedly.
'Yes; and he do contrive to stumble
.p295
upon her whenever she walks out on fine
days with the chiel. But, Mr. Yeobright, I
can't help feeling that your cousin ought to
have married you. 'Tis a pity to make two
chimley-corners where there need be only
one. You could get her away from him
now, 'tis my belief, if you were only to set
about it.'
   'How can I have the conscience to marry
after having driven two women to their
deaths? Don't think such a thing, Hum-
phrey. After my experience I should con-
sider it too much of a burlesque to go to
church and take a wife. In the words of Job,
\"
\"I have made a covenant with mine eyes;
why then should I think upon a maid?\"'
? \" '
   'No, Mr. Clym, don't fancy that about
driving two women to their deaths. You
shouldn't say it.'
   'Well, we'll leave that out,' said Yeo-
bright. ‘But anyhow the times have set a
mark upon me which wouldn't look well in a
love-making scene. I have two ideas in my
.p296 THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE.
head, and no others. I am going to keep
a night-school; and I am going to turn
preacher. What have you got to say to that,
Humphrey?'
'I'll come and hear ye with all my heart.'
'Thanks. 'Tis all I wish.'
   As Clym descended into the valley
Thomasin came down by the other path,
and met him at the gate. ‘What do you
think I have to tell you, Clym?' she said,
looking archly over her shoulder at him.
'I can guess,' he replied.
   She scrutinised his face. ‘Yes, you guess
right. It is going to be after all. He thinks
I may as well make up my mind, and I have
   got to think so too. It is to be on the
twenty-fifth of next month, if you don't
object.'
   'Do what you think right, dear. I am
only too glad that you see your way clear to
happiness again. My sex owes you every
amends for the treatment you received in
days gone by.'

CHAPTER IV.
CHEERFULNESS AGAIN ASSERTS ITSELF AT
BLOOMS-END, AND CLYM FINDS HIS VO-
CATION.
ANYBODY who had passed through Blooms-
End about eleven o'clock on the morning
fixed for the wedding would have found
that, while Yeobright's house was compara-
tively quiet, sounds denoting great activity
came from the dwelling of his nearest neigh-
bour, Timothy Fairway. It was chiefly a
noise of feet, briskly crunching hither and
thither over the sanded floor within. One
man only was visible outside, and he seemed
to be later at an appointment than he had
intended to be, for he hastened up to the
door, lifted the latch, and walked in without
ceremony.
   The scene within was not quite the cus-
.p298 THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE.
tomary one. Standing about the room was
the little knot of men who formed the chief
part of the Egdon coterie, there being pre-
sent Fairway himself, Grandfer Cantle, Hum-
phrey, Christian, and one or two turf-cutters.
   It was a warm day, and the men were as a
matter of course in their shirt-sleeves, except
Christian, who had always a nervous fear of
parting with a scrap of his clothing when in
anybody's house but his own. Across the
stout oak table in the middle of the room was
thrown a mass of striped linen, which Grand-
fer Gantle held down on one side, and Hum-
hrey on the other, while Fairway rubbed its
p
surface with a yellow lump, his face being
damp and creased with the effort of the
labour.
   'Waxing a bed-tick, souls?' said the new-
comer.
   'Yes, Sam,' said Grandfer Cantle, as a
man too busy to waste words. ‘Shall I
stretch this corner a shade tighter, Ti-
mothy?'
   Fairway replied, and the waxing went on
with unabated vigour. ‘'Tis going to be a
   good bed, by the look o't,' continued Sam,
after an interval of silence. ‘Who may it
be for?'
   'Tis a present for the new folks that's
going to set up housekeeping,' said Chris-
tian, who stood helpless and overcome by
the majesty of the proceedings.
   'Ah, to be sure; and a valuable one, 'a
b'lieve.'
   'Beds be dear to fokes that don't keep
geese, baint they, Mister Fairway?' said
Christian, as to an omniscient being.
   'Yes,' said the furze-dealer, standing up,
giving his forehead a thorough mopping, and
handing the beeswax to Humphrey, who suc-
ceeded at the rubbing forthwith. ‘Not that
this couple be in want of one, but 'twas well
to show 'em a bit of friendliness at this great
racketing vagary of their lives. I set up both
my own daughters in one when they were mar-
ried, and there have been feathers enough for
   300 THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE.
another in the house the last twelve months.
Now, then, neighbours, I think we have laid
on enough wax. Grandfer Cantle, you turn
the tick the right way outwards, and then I'll
begin to shake in the feathers.'
   When the bed was in proper trim Fair-
way and Christian brought forward vast
paper bags, stuffed to the full, but light as
p
balloons, and began to turn the contents of
each into the receptacle just prepared. As
bag after bag was emptied airy tufts of down
and feathers floated about the room in in-
creasing quantity till, through a mishap of
Christian's, who shook the contents of one
bag outside the tick, the atmosphere of the
room became dense with gigantic flakes,
which descended upon the workers like a
windless snowstorm.
   'I never saw such a clumsy chap as
you, Christian,' said Grandfer Cantle severely.
'You might have been the son of a man
that's never been outside Blooms-End in his
life for all the wit you have. Really all the
   301
soldiering and smartness in the world in the
father seems to count for nothing in forming the
nater of the son. As far as that chiel Christian
is concerned I might as well have stayed at
home and seed nothing like all the rest of ye
here. Though, as far as myself is concerned,
a dashing spirit has counted for sommat, to
be sure.'
   'Don't ye let me down so, father; I feel
no bigger than a ninepin after it. I've made
but a bruckle hit, I'm afeard.'
   'Come, come. Never pitch yerself in
such a low key as that, Christian; you
should try more,' said Fairway.
   'Yes, you should try more,' echoed the
Grandfer with insistence, as if he had been
the first to make the suggestion. ‘In com-
mon conscience every man ought either to
marry or go for a soldier. 'Tis a scandal to the
nation to do neither one nor t'other. I did
both, thank God. Neither to raise men nor
to lay 'em low--that shows a poor do-nothing
spirit indeed.'
   303
Fairway. ‘Empt some more feathers into
the bed-tick, and keep up yer heart. Though
rather lean in the stalks you be a green-
leaved old man still. There's time enough
left to ye yet to fill whole chronicles.'
   'Begad, I'll go to 'em, Timothy--to the
married pair!' said Grandfer Cantle in an
encouraged voice, and starting round briskly.
   'I'll go to 'em to-night, and sing a wed-
ding-song, hey? 'Tis like me to do so
you know; and they'd see it as such. My

   gie the bed a shake down. We've put in
seventy pound of best feathers, and I think
that's as many as the tick will fairly hold.
A bit and a drap wouldn't be amiss now, I
reckon. Christian, maul down the victuals
from corner-cupboard if canst reach, man; and
I'll draw a drap o' sommat to wet it with.'
   They sat down to a lunch in the midst
of their work, feathers around, above, and
below them; the original owners of which
occasionally looked in at the open door and
cackled begrudgingly at sight of such a
quantity of their old clothes.
   'Upon my soul I shall be chokt,' said
Fairway when, having extracted a feather
from his mouth, he found several others float-
ing on the mug as it was handed round.
   'I've swallered several; and one had a
tolerable quill,' said Sam placidly from the
corner.
   305
   'Hullo -- what's that? -- wheels I hear
coming?' Grandfer Cantle exclaimed, jump-
ing up and hastening to the door. ‘Why,
'tis they back again: I didn't expect 'em yet
this half-hour. To be sure, how quick mar-
rying can be done when you are in the mind
for't!'
   'Oh, yes, it can soon be done,' said Fair-
way, as if something should be added to
make the statement complete.
   He arose and followed the Grandfer, and
the rest also went to the door. In a moment
an open fly was driven past, in which sat
Venn and Mrs. Venn, Yeobright, and a
   grand relative of Venn's who had come from
Budmouth for the occasion. The fly had
been hired at the nearest town, regardless of
distance and cost, there being nothing on
Egdon Heath, in Venn's opinion, dignified
enough for such an event when such a
woman as Thomasin was the bride; and
the church was too remote for a walking
bridal-party.
VOL. III.
   As the fly passed the group which had
run out from the homestead they shouted
   'Hurrah!' and waved their hands; feathers
and down floating from their hair, their
sleeves, and the folds of their garments at
every motion, and Grandfer Cantle's seals
dancing merrily in the sunlight as he twirled
himself about. The driver of the fly turned
a supercilious gaze upon them; he even
treated the wedded pair themselves with
something of condescension; for in what
other state than heathen could people, rich
or poor, exist who were doomed to abide in
such a world's end as Egdon? Thomasin
showed no such superiority to the group at
the door, fluttering her hand as quickly as a
bird's wing towards them, and asking Dig-
   gory, with tears in her eyes, if they ought
not to alight and speak to these kind neigh-
bours. Venn, however, suggested that, as
they were all coming to the house in the
evening, this was hardly necessary.
   After this excitement the saluting party

307
returned to their occupation, and the stuffing
and sewing was soon afterwards finished;
when Fairway harnessed a horse, wrapped
up the cumbrous present, and drove off with
it in the cart to Venn's house at North
Shadwater.
   Yeobright, having filled the office at the
wedding-service which naturally fell to his
hands, and afterwards returned to the house
with the husband and wife, was indisposed to
take part in the feasting and dancing that
wound up the evening. Thomasin was dis-
appointed.
   'I wish I could be there without dashing
your spirits,' he said. ‘But I might be too
much like the skull at the banquet.'
   'No, no.'
   'Well, dear, apart from that, if you would
excuse me, I should be glad. I know it
seems unkind; but, dear Thomasin, I fear I
should not be happy in the company--there
X 2
   308 THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE.
that's the truth of it. I shall always be
coming to see you at your new home, you
know, so that my absence now will not much
matter.'
   'Then I give in. Do whatever will be
most comfortable to yourself.'
   Clym retired to his lodging at the house-
top much relieved, and occupied himself
during the afternoon in noting down the
heads of a sermon, with which he intended
to initiate all that really seemed practicable
of the scheme that had originally brought
him hither, and that he had so long kept in
view under various modifications, and through
evil and good report. He had tested and
weighed his convictions again and again, and
saw no reason to alter them, though he had
considerably lessened his plan. His eye-
sight, by long humouring in his native air,
had grown stronger, but not sufficiently
strong to warrant his attempting his exten-
sive educational project. Yet he did not
   309
repine: there was still more than enough of
an unambitious sort to tax all his energies
and occupy all his hours.
   Evening drew on, and sounds of life and
movement in the lower part of the domicile
became more pronounced, the gate in the
palings clicking incessantly. The party was
to be an early one, and all the guests were
assembled long before it was dark. Yeo-
bright went down the back staircase and into
the heath by another path than that in front,
intending to walk in the open air till the
party was over, when he would return to
wish Thomasin and her husband good-bye
as they departed. His steps were insensibly
bent towards Mistover by the path that he
had followed on that terrible morning when
he learnt the strange news from Susan's
boy.

see over the whole quarter that had once
been Eustacia's home. While he stood ob-

serving the darkening scene somebody came
up. Clym, seeing him but dimly, would
have let him pass by silently, had not the
pedestrian, who was Charley, recognised the
young man and spoken to him.
   'Charley, I have not seen you for a
length of time,' said Yeobright. ‘Do you
often walk this way?'
   'No,' the lad replied.
come outside the bank.'
'I don't often
   'You were not at the Maypole.'
   'No,' said Charley in the same listless
tone. ‘I don't care for that sort of thing
now.'
   'You rather liked Miss Eustacia, didn't
you?' Yeobright gently asked. Eustacia had
frequently told him of Charley's romantic
attachment.
   'Yes, very much. Ah, I wish--'
   'Yes?'
   'I wish, Mr. Yeobright, you could give
me something to keep that once belonged to
her--if you don't mind.'
   'I shall be very happy to. It will give
me very great pleasure, Charley. Let me
think what I have of hers that you would
like. But come with me to the house, and
I'll see.'
   gether. When they reached the front it was
dark, and the shutters were closed, so that
nothing of the interior could be seen.
   'Come round this way,' said Clym. ‘My
entrance is at the back for the present.'
   The two went round and ascended the
crooked stair in darkness till Clym's sitting-
room on the upper floor was reached, where
he lit a candle, Charley entering gently be-
hind. Yeobright searched his desk, and taking
out a sheet of tissue-paper unfolded from it
two or three undulating locks of raven hair,
which fell over the paper like black streams.
From these he selected one, wrapped it
up, and gave it to the lad, whose eyes had
filled with tears. He kissed the packet, put
it in his pocket, and said in a voice of emo-
   312 THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE.
tion, ‘Oh, Mr. Clym, how good you are to
me!'
   'I will go a little way with you,' said
Clym. And amid the noise of merriment
from below they descended. Their path to the
front led them close to a little side-window,
whence the rays of candles streamed across
the shrubs. The window, being screened
from general observation by the bushes,
had been left unblinded, so that a person
in this private nook could see all that was
going on within the room which contained
the wedding guests, except in so far as vision
was hindered by the green antiquity of the
panes.
   'Charley, what are they doing?' said
Clym. ‘My sight is weaker again to-
night, and the glass of this window is not
good.'
   Charley wiped his own eyes, which were
rather blurred with moisture, and stepped
closer to the casement. ‘Mr. Venn is asking
Christian Cantle to sing,' he replied; ‘ and
   313
Christian is moving about in his chair as if
he were much frightened at the question, and
his father has struck up a stave instead of
him.'
   'Yes, I can hear the old man's voice,'
said Clym. ‘So there's to be no dancing, I
suppose. And is Thomasin in the room? I
see something moving in front of the candles
that resembles her shape, I think.'
   'Yes. She do seem happy. She is red
in the face and laughing at something Fair-
way has said to her. Oh, my!'
   'What noise was that?' said Clym.
   'Mr. Venn is so tall that he has knocked
his head against the beam in gieing a skip as
he passed under. Mrs. Venn hev run up
quite frightened, and now she's put her hand
to his head to feel if there's a lump. And
now they be all laughing again as if nothing
had happened.'
   'Do any of them seem to care about my
not being there?' Clym asked,
   'No, not a bit in the world. Now they
   314 THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE.
are all holding up their glasses and drinking
somebody's health.'
   'I wonder if it is mine?'
   'No, 'tis Mr. and Mrs. Venn's, because
he is making a hearty sort of speech. There
--now Mrs. Venn has got up, and is going
away to put on her things, I think.'
   'Well, they haven't concerned themselves
about me, and it is quite right they should
not. It is all as it should be, and Thomasin
at least is happy. We will not stay any
longer now, as they will soon be coming out
to go home.'
   He accompanied the lad into the heath
on his way home, and, returning alone to the
house a quarter of an hour later, found Venn
and Thomasin ready to start, all the guests
having departed in his absence. The wedded
pair took their seats in the four-wheeled dog-
cart which Venn's head milker and handy
man had driven from Shadwater to fetch
them in; little Eustacia and the nurse were
packed securely upon the opened flap behind;
   315
and the milker, on an ancient overstepping
pony, whose shoes clashed like cymbals at
every tread, rode in the rear, in the manner
of a body-servant of the last century.
   'Now we leave you in absolute posses-
sion of your own house again,' said Thomasin
as she bent down to wish her cousin good-
night. 'It will be rather lonely for you,
Clym, after the hubbub we have been
making.'
   'Oh, that's no inconvenience,' said Clym,
smiling rather sadly. And then the party
drove off and vanished in the night-shades,
and Yeobright entered the house. The tick-
ing of the clock was the only sound that
   greeted him, for not a soul remained; Chris-
tian, who acted as cook, valet, and gardener
to Clym, sleeping at his father's house. Yeo-
bright sat down in one of the vacant chairs,
and remained in thought a long time. His
mother's old chair was opposite; it had been
sat in that evening by those who had scarcely
remembered that it ever was hers. But to
   316 THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE.
Clym she was almost a presence there,
now as always. Whatever she was in other
people's memories, in his she was the sublime
saint whose radiance even his tenderness for
Eustacia could not obscure. But his heart
was heavy; that mother had not crowned
him in the day of his espousals and in the
day of the gladness of his heart. And events
had borne out the accuracy of her judgment,
and proved the devotedness of her care. He
should have heeded her for Eustacia's sake
even more than for his own. ‘It was all my
fault,' he whispered. ‘ Oh, my mother, my
mother! would to God that I could live my
life again, and endure for you what you en-
dured for me!'
   On the Sunday after this wedding an un-
usual sight was to be seen on Blackbarrow.
From a distance there simply appeared to be
a motionless figure standing on the top of the
tumulus, just as Eustacia had stood on that
lonely summit some two years and a half
   317
before. But now it was fine warm weather,
with only a summer breeze blowing, and
early afternoon instead of dull twilight.
Those who ascended to the immediate
neighbourhood of the Barrow perceived that
the erect form in the centre, piercing the sky,
was not really alone. Round him upon the
slopes of the Barrow a number of heathmen
and women were reclining or sitting at their
ease. They listened to the words of the man
in their midst, who was preaching, while they
abstractedly pulled heather, stripped ferns, or
tossed pebbles down the slope. This was the
first of a series of moral lectures or sermons
on the mount, which were to be delivered
from the same place every Sunday afternoon
as long as the fine weather lasted.
   The commanding elevation of Blackbar-
row had been chosen for two reasons: first,
that it occupied a central position among the
remote cottages around; secondly, that the
preacher thereon could be seen from all ad-
jacent points as soon as he arrived at his post,
   318 THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE.
the view of him being thus a convenient sig-
nal to those stragglers who wished to draw
near. The speaker was bareheaded, and the
breeze at each waft gently lifted and lowered
his hair, somewhat too thin for a man of his
years, these still numbering less than thirty.
He wore a shade over his eyes, and his face
was pensive and lined; but, though these
bodily features were marked with decay,
there was no defect in the tones of his
voice, which were rich, musical, and stirring.&nbsp;
He stated that his discourses to people were
to be sometimes secular, and sometimes re-
ligious, but never dogmatic; and that his
texts would be taken from all kinds of
books. This afternoon the words were as
follows:--
‘ \"
   '\"And the king rose up to meet her, and
bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his
throne, and caused a seat to be set for the
king's mother; and she sat on his right hand.
Then she said, I desire one small petition of
thee; I pray thee say me not nay. And the
   319
king said unto her, Ask on, my mother: for
I will not say thee nay.\"'
\" '
   Yeobright had, in fact, found his vocation
in the career of an itinerant open-air preacher
and lecturer on morally unimpeachable sub-
jects; and from this day he laboured inces-
santly in that office, speaking not only in
simple language on Blackbarrow and in the
upland hamlets round, but in a more culti-
vated strain elsewhere--from the steps and
   porticoes of town-halls, from market-crosses,
from conduits, on esplanades and on wharves,
from the parapets of bridges, in barns and
outhouses, and all other such places in the
neighbouring Wessex towns and villages.
He left alone set creeds and systems of
